    In the vast digital expanse of Second Life, we found more than pixels; we found a frontier. Since 2025, the Gate Builders collective has stood as a beacon for those who believe that virtual worlds are not just games, but extensions of human creativity and social evolution.

    Our mission is simple yet profound: to build, to connect, and to preserve. We believe in the power of open protocols, the beauty of optimized architecture, and the necessity of community-driven governance. We are the architects of the Stargate network—a series of interconnected experiences that defy the boundaries of individual regions.

    We strive for technical excellence. Every line of LSL, every triangle in a mesh, every event coordinated is a testament to our dedication to a high-fidelity future. We are not just building structures; we are building a universe.

    Join us as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible within the virtual realm. The gate is open. The future is built by us.
